    <h1>Wind of Change</h1>
    <p>I follow the Moskva down to Gorky Park
        Listening to the wind of change
        An August summer night, soldiers passing by
        Listening to the wind of change
        The world is closing in
        And did you ever think
        That we could be so close like brothers?
        The future's in the air, I can feel it everywhere
        I'm blowing with the wind of change
        Take me to the magic of the moment
        On a glory night
        Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)
        In the wind of change
        Mh-mmh
        Walking down the street
        And distant memories are buried in the past forever
        I follow the Moskva and down to Gorky Park
        Listening to the wind of change
        Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
        On a glory night (a glory night)
        Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (share their dreams)
        With you and me (with you and me)
        Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
        On a glory night (a glory night)
        Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)
        In the wind of change (the wind of change)
        The wind of change blows straight into the face of time
        Like a storm wind that will ring the freedom bell for peace of mind
        Let your balalaika sing what my guitar wants to say (say)
        Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
        On a glory night (a glory night)
        Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (share their dreams)
        With you and me (you and me)
        Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
        On a glory night (a glory night)
        Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)
        In the wind of change (the wind of change)</p>
